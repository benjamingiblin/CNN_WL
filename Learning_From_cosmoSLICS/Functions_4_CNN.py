# DETAILS ABOUT cosmoSLICS:

# 1. There are 26 cosmologies with IDs ['fid', '00', '01', '02',...,'24']

# 2. Each cosmology has two input "seeds" designated 'a' or 'f'
# the seeds determine the initial conditions in the simulated Universe
# And there are two specially chosen such that the average of the power spectra
# in the 'a' and the 'f' simulated Universes is very close to the
# theoretical predictions.

# 3. For each cosmology and seed, there are 25 different realisations of the
# simulated Universe numbered 1 to 25. These give us an idea of the variance
# in the ways a Universe with a given cosmology can evolve (necessary for
# statistical inference of the cosmological parameters in data).

# The cosmoSLICS shear component 1 map, for cosmology 00, seed a, and realisation 1 is stored at:
# /home/bengib/cosmoSLICS/00_a/GalCat/Shear_Maps/Res128x128/ZBcut0.1-1.2/Shear1_LOS1_SNNone.fits

# More info on cosmoSLICS can be found in Harnois-Deraps, Giblin and Joachimi (2019):
